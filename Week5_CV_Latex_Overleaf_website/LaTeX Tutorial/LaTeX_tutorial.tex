% WARNING: This beamer presentation will likely not compile if you are compiling from a local TeX distribution - you will need to install the minted package to activate the syntax-highlighted code blocks. Minted also requires a Python package, pygmentize, to work. Installing this is annoying. Further, an extra command-line option must be used for the document to compile properly. Check 
% https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/279214/pygmentize-not-working-properly-with-minted-package-in-texshop-on-os-x
% if you have issues installing it on Mac OS X.
% Alternatively, Overleaf has (basically) every LaTeX package available, so this should run fine there
