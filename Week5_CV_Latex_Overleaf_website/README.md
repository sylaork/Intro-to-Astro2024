# Agenda:

### Intro
- Intro, Check-in.

### Tutorial:
1. Creating a Curriculum Vitae (CV)
2. Creating a website
3. Latex and Overleaf for writing papers

# Assignments:
1. Look up the personal websites (NOT university faculty page!) of at least five different astronomers. Explore them in detail. Write an entry in your notebook describing what you like and what you don't like. Remember, a website is often times many people's first impression of you, what do you want them to know? Remember to consider content as well as aesthetics. Use this in planning a design for your personal website.

2. Review these astronomers' CVs which are always posted somewhere on their websites. Record trends in your notebook. What aspects of their CVs do you want to emulate? Do they have sections of their CV that we did not cover or bring up?

3. Read this article on building a website: https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/uploads/2017-11/ECR_Building_personal_website_210912.pdf
